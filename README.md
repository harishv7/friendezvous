**1. Ideation:**

The current problem many people
experience is finding a suitable time slot and place to meet with project
mates, friends or colleagues. This has become a hassle since different people
have different daily schedules and speaking from experience, we have seen many
resort to manually asking teammates for their schedule one by one and then
consolidating a free time to meet. Such a manual process is laborious and
tiring. Hence, we propose the idea of a webapp titled “Friendezvous”.

Friendezvous will target a vast group of
people who are often involved in meetings. Our primary focus will be students,
teachers, office-goers and the youth and their friend circles.

Team members can simply select their
available time slots and place they will be at and the webapp will compute the
best time and location for the entire team to meet.

Our plan for the 3 evaluation milestones
are as follows:

 

_Milestone 1 (Project Ideation):_ 

Have a clear and defined scope of the
project and have a basic template for the webapp. A simple login system will be
inplace and the necessary pages, such as homepages, contact-us, about, sign-up,
login pages will be completed.

 

_Milestone 2 (Minimum Viable Project):_

Have a fully-functional algorithm that
runs smoothly on user-input schedules to output the best time to meet. The best
place to meet will be reflected with the integration of the Google Maps API and
a majority of the core features will be in place.

 

_Milestone 3 (Extensions):_

Complete the webapp and integrate Open ID
login for Google+ and Facebook. Add functionality for users to collaborate.

 

_Features completed as of now:_

Web layout and template with a login
system & signup page for new users to create an account, and schedule
database.

 

**2. Planned Features:**

 

The following features on the Trello
cards (look after the screenshots)  are the planned features. The lists
under “Currently under Development” section form the core of the application
and will be crucial for the app to be fully functional.

 

The following user stories list the
expected core features of the webapp:

 

- As
     a **user**, I want to login into my account to create a new
     meeting or to view existing meetings.
- As
     a **user**, I want to select my available time slots and preferred
     choice of meeting place.
- As
     a **user**, I want to invite my friends or members to form a team
     for the meeting so that they will be able to select their own preferred
     and available schedule as well.
- As an** event
     or meeting host** (admin of the meeting), I want to be able to
     create a new meeting with a description to initiate the formation of a new
     meetup.
- As
     a **team member**, I want to receive a confirmation request to
     confirm the time and place of meeting.
- As
     a **team member**, I want to receive a notification and final
     confirmation of the details of the meeting.
- As
     a **team member**, I want to see the confirmed meetings on my
     dashboard so that I can quickly and effectively know the scheduled
     meetings for the day.

 

The completed features as of now can be
seen in the following screenshots of the webpage.

Once these features are fulfilled, as per
the agile methodology we plan to test-drive the application with our friends to
understand the positives and negatives. Subsequently, we will try to achieve
some of the advanced features. In the 2

nd sprint, we plan to
improve upon the algorithm and compress contents to make it as efficient as
possible in order minimise page-loads and maximise user experience.

We plan to achieve most of the features
by working together to build on top of each other’s ideas and suggestions.
Harish will be mainly responsible for the client-side and front-end development
while Alvian will be assigned the server-side and back-end development. We will
jointly work on the algorithm and optimisation of the application.
